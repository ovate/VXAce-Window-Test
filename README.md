# VXAce-Window-Test
Game.exe lets you try out windows inside Graphics/System folder

I used RPG Maker VX Ace with Himeworks script to make Windowskin Tester.

To start (VX Ace)

1. Put the windowskin inside Graphics/System folder, file name has to be "Window" or "Window#" # is 1 through 5
- You can replace the existing window with the window you want to try out.
2. Double-click on Game.exe to run application
3. Then interact with the choices for results
